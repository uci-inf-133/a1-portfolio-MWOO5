--Readme document for Mandy Woo, mwoo5@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
I added at least one image with descriptive alt attributes, appropriate headings and paragraph text, links to external pages, multiple pages w/ appropriate navigation between them, and semantic HTML tags. 


(b) CSS features
I added modified padding and margins, and modified links, text color, and other colors to be visually appealing. Lastly, I added a custom Google font (Outfit) for use throughout my entire website.


(c) Advanced features
I added a navigation bar and a contact form that leverages HTML forms. 



3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
I only ignored the potential problems. These did not seem like an accessibility concern at the moment because a lot of the problems were due to my alt text 'possibly' not matching the associated photo, when it actually does. Some of the potential problems also suggests I create a simpler layout for my website as I have slightly different layouts for each page, but I feel that because my pages are very short and easily readable, it is not necessary. Another potential problem I received for most of my pages was that link texts may not be meaningful, but I had to shorten them because they are present on my navigation bar. A bar with long titles for each page would distract the reader. 


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
I worked incrementally for about 5 days, with around 2-3 hours each day. So probably about 12-15 hours total including a lot of research time as well.


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
I used a lot of W3 Schools references during this assignment. For example:
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp
I also used this HTML cheatsheet I found online a few times: https://devdocs.io/html/guides/cheatsheet


6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I did not consult any classmates or individuals when completing this assignment, other than two quick Slack messages discussing contact forms and CSS styling.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Nope! I did not use any frameworks to create my code.
